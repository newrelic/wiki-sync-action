# Bi-directional Wiki Sync Action

[![GitHub Marketplace version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/newrelic/wiki-sync-action.svg?label=Marketplace&logo=github)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/bi-directional-wiki-sync-action)

A GitHub Action that synchronizes the contents of a directory to the repository's Wiki.

This project is a fork of [SwiftDocOrg/github-wiki-publish-action](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/github-wiki-publish-action) and attribution is noted in the [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](./THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). The basic enhancement is this adds syncronization so edits made directly to the Wiki can flow back to the repo directory.

> Note: This "sync" only works for create/update of a file in the wiki. Deletes will not propogate back due to limitations of the GitHub API gollum event. For deletes, remove the file from the directory and the directory -> wiki sync will remove the file.

### Bi-directional Sync Workflow

The following example shows how to use the `wiki-sync-action` in conjunction with the `gollum` event.

> NOTE: Either `source` or `destination` _must_ be set to `wiki`. The action will error out if an attempt is made to not sync a directory with the wiki.

```yaml
name: Documentation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop
    paths:
      - "docs/**"
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [docs]
  gollum:

env:
  GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: Actionbot
  GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: actions@github.com

jobs:
  job-sync-docs-to-wiki:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name != 'gollum'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Sync docs to wiki
        uses: newrelic/wiki-sync-action@main
        with:
          source: docs
          destination: wiki
          token: ${{ secrets.NEWRELIC_BOT_TOKEN }}
          gitAuthorName: ${{ env.GIT_AUTHOR_NAME }}
          gitAuthorEmail: ${{ env.GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL }}
  
  job-sync-wiki-to-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'gollum'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.NEWRELIC_BOT_TOKEN }} # allows us to push back to repo
          ref: develop
      - name: Sync Wiki to Docs
        uses: newrelic/wiki-sync-action@main
        with:
          source: wiki
          destination: docs
          token: ${{ secrets.NEWRELIC_BOT_TOKEN }}
          gitAuthorName: ${{ env.GIT_AUTHOR_NAME }}
          gitAuthorEmail: ${{ env.GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL }}
          branch: develop # since default branch is develop in this example
```
